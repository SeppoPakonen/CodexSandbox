# ManiaCurvy â€” Current Task

- Scaffold package and main header.
- Define bare `CurvySpline` data model and minimal sampling API. [DONE]
- Implement Catmull-Rom interpolation first; TCB later. [DONE]
- Add global T/C/B parameters and interpolation mode toggle. [DONE]
- Add polyline approximation, tangents, length and TF/distance mapping. [DONE]
- Add nearest-point TF and MoveBy with clamping modes. [DONE]
- Add cached approximation and cumulative length tables; invalidate on edits. [DONE]
- Add closed-curve option and per-point T/C/B overrides. [DONE]
- Add arc-length LUT and fast MoveBy using LUT for approximate sampling. [DONE]
- Add constant-step MoveBy using LUT index stepping; add demo coverage. [DONE]
