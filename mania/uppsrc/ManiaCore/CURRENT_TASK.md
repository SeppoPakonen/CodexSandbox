# ManiaCore â€” Current Task

- Scaffolded package and main header.
- Implement `AlphaNum` comparator (natural sort) and basic utils.
- Keep Prefs/Logger as minimal stubs for now.
- Added `Hash` (MD5 wrappers) and `Http` (GET/POST with optional cache).

Next
- Validate comparator with sample inputs.
- Consider adding a tiny console demo later.
 - Add unit-style checks for Http when network is available (skipped in demo).
