FIPS123  README

This is the FIPS123 C library that provides convenient access to
ISO8211 files.  The version number of this release can be found in 
the file VERSION. You will need an ANSI C compiler to build this 
library. (See INSTALL for information)

The point of contact for this software is sdts@usgs.gov. 
(However, resources are not available to provide technical assistance, 
and FIPS123 has been retired at final version of 1.0.4. 
The contents of this distribution should be all 
that you need---and in most cases it represents all we can offer anyway :)

If you do not have a C compiler, then check the web pages at 
http://mcmcweb.er.usgs.gov/sdts for precompiled utilities (for PC) that are 
based on this FIPS123 library.
