April 14, 1997     Version 1.0.4

           FIPS PUB 123 Function Library Version 1.0.4

                          Release Notes

This file describes the modifications contained in the FIPS123
Function Library version 1.0.4.  Please read these notes as they
may be important to your application.

General Notes:

  Many failure reports against the FIPS123 library in regards to reading 
binary data are caused by corrupt *.DDF files.  The most common cause was 
the use of WinZip (tm) to unpack the files. The option for "Smart TAR 
file CR/LF conversion" must be turned off. Failure to do so will cause
data reading errors in the SDTS Line Module (files with name 
xxxxLEnn.DDF)   [96DR003]      The second most common cause is failing to 
set ftp mode to binary before downloading a tar/zip file 
(extension *.tar.gz).

  The FIPS123 library implements the 1986 version of ISO 8211. The latest 
version of ISO 8211 is 1995. There are no plans at this time to upgrade 
this library to the 1995 version.    [96SN006]


Testing environment:

   The FIPS123 version 1.04 has only been tested in the Unix environment 
prior to its first release on 4-14-97. GNU C compiler version 2.5.8 was
used on a Data General AViiON running DG/UX 5.4.3. 


Modifications:

The following DRs (discrepancy reports) and SN (statement of needs) have
been implemented in this version. (DRs and SNs are documented in HISTORY.)

1.  Reading of binary data would stop short when a field terminator 
(hex 1e) was encountered at the beginning of a subfield in a binary 
stream.  Problem fixed (change made to routine ret123fv). [96DR001]

2.  Writing would terminate early if writing binary data an entire 
field at a time and one of its subfields started with a field terminator 
(hex 1e). Problem fixed (change made to routine ret123fv). Test program 
testfld.c was added in f123app to test this change. [96DR002]

3.  Read-only mode was actually opening up the files with update enabled. 
This would cause failure when reading SDTS data from a CDROM. Routine 
beg123file was modified to not open read-only files for update. [96DR004] 

4.  Added Make files to make the library, utilities, and sample programs 
in the Unix environment. (No precompiled executables are contained in the 
distribution.)   (This software will compile and execute on a PC, but 
there is no standardized make facility.)   [96SN005]
  
5.  Cleaned up some memory leaks in the function library which were 
detected by a source code analyzer tool (Pure Software's (TM) Purify)

6.  An SDTS Transfer has been included in the f123app directory to be 
used as test data.

7.  Appendix E of the Programmers Reference Manual has been shortened by 
removing a lengthy source code listing.  The other documentation has not 
been updated and may contain out of date source, installation, and 
technical contact information. See README and INSTALL for latest information.

           FIPS PUB 123 Function Library Version 1.0.3

                          Release Notes


This file describes the modifications contained in the FIPS123
Function Library version 1.0.3.  Please read these notes as they
may be important to your application.

With the resolution and implementation of 93DR033, this version of
the library supports the use of an array descriptor in place of
labels in an ISO 8211 DDR.

September 14, 1993   Version 1.0.2

           FIPS PUB 123 Function Library Version 1.0.2

                          Release Notes

This file describes the modifications contained in the FIPS123
Function Library version 1.0.2.  Please read these notes as they
may be important to your application.

The following DRs have been resolved and are implemented within
version 1.0.2 of the library.


     93DR030 - Failure of function wr123sfld() to load the correct
               data structures with the array descriptors present
               in the DR field

     93DR031 - A Segmenation fault occurs when function
               chk123nsfld() is invoked for a DR field that
               contains Cartesian data with no labels present in
               the corresponding DDR field

     93DR036 - Failure of wr123sfld() when writing a field
               containing array descriptors and attempting to drop
               the leader and directory (using leader ID 'R')

     93DR037 - Use of the memset system function

     93DR038 - Unable to write subfield containing binary value
               255 (decimal)

     93DR039 - Function wr123fld() performance

     93DR040 - Writing formatted arrays containing adjacent
               fixed-length binary subfields that do not end on a
               byte boundary
