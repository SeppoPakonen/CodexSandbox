FIPS123 INSTALL NOTES

This is the FIPS123 C library that provides convenient access to
ISO8211 files.  The version number of this release can be found in 
the file VERSION. You will need an ANSI C compiler to build this 
library. 

The point of contact for this software is sdts@usgs.gov. 
(However, resources are not always immediately available to provide 
technical assistance. The contents of this distribution should be all 
that you need---and in most cases it represents all we can offer anyway :)

If you do not have a C compiler, then check the web pages at 
http://mcmcweb.er.usgs.gov/sdts for precompiled utilities (for PC) that are 
based on this FIPS123 library.


Installation for Unix with make facility:
=========================================

1. Copy/untar the distribution files into a directory "fips123" or a 
custom directory name. There will be a couple of subdirectories created 
(contents explained in file README.)  

2. For Unix, you would then issue "make" to build the library 
and all executables. Issue make from the "fips123" or your custom directory.
At this point the library is available (fips123.a), and the sample programs 
and all utilities are ready to execute.

3. (Optional) If you want to install the executable files to another 
directory, then do this step.

The default install directory ( prefix ) will be /usr/local:

	fips123 library will be installed in /usr/local/lib
	fips123 header files will be installed in /usr/local/include
	fips123 utility files will be installed in /usr/local/bin

If you would like to install fips123 in a different directory, edit 
the Makefile in the top directory of fips123, change "prefix=/usr/local" 
to your preference directory, then do "make install".


Uninstall:
==========
This is not currently supported, but you can do:

	% make clean
or
	% make realclean

to clean up the binary files under the tree of fips123
