                          SDTS Browse Utility
                 program:         show173.c
                 author:          Bob Lazar
                 date:            November 27, 1992
                 language:        C
         This program interactively dumps SDTS records, one at a time.  
         Output goes to both the computer screen/window
         and a report file on disk.  At any point, the user can key in "b" to
         switch to batch mode to output the remainder of the file only to the 
       disk file.
         This program is an example which uses the FIPS 123 Function Library.  
         This is a public domain software library which supports the SDTS, 
         FIPS 173, an exchange standard for digital spatial data which uses 
         ANSI/ISO 8211 (FIPS 123) for its physical file implementation.
         The FIPS 123 Function Library has been developed on the MS/DOS
         and Data General AViiON Unix platforms.  It has been developed
         using the ANSI standard C language.  It has not been fully
         tested on other platforms.
         To obtain this library or obtain additional information on the
         SDTS, contact the following address:
