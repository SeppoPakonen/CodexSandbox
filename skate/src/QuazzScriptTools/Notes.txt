Instructions:
1).  'Open Roq cmd.exe', it is a gui interface for roq.exe
2).  To decompile a qb, select the decompile bullet and the qb from the list, and hit decompile.  For THUG1, select the -THUG1 flag from the upper dropdown box.
3).  Make changes to the source QB.
4).  To compile, select the compile bullet and the qb from the list, and hit compile.

Notes:

1). Roq.exe is actually a custom build of 'Qb_View.exe' from the thugpro files.
2). If there is an error on compiling, a temp.dump file should be produced in the working directory and it can be viewed in a text editor.
3). These tools are actually old and deprecated.
